# C Debugging Project

Welcome to the C Debugging Project! This small collection focuses on debugging C programs to ensure correct functionality.

## Program Highlights

   - This file tests the function `positive_or_negative()` to ensure it gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

2. **2-largest_number.c:**
   - A program that prints the largest of three integers. This program is designed to be debugged for correct functionality.

3. **3-print_remaining_days.c:**
   - A program that converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, considering leap years. This program is designed to be debugged for accurate results.
