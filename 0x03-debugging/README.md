I am a small project on debugging in C.
0-main.c file tests that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.
2-largest_number.c is a program that prints the largest of three integers.
3-print_remaining_days.c is a program that converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
