# Project Title: Understanding Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

## Description

This project is focused on deepening the understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. It aims to provide practical experience through a series of tasks that emphasize the use and manipulation of these fundamental elements in C.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants are expected to be proficient in:

- Understanding and using pointers in C.
- Working with arrays, including multi-dimensional arrays.
- Understanding the key differences between pointers and arrays.
- Manipulating strings using various techniques.
- Grasping the concept of variable scope in C.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compilation**: Files will be compiled with `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **Coding Style**: All C files must adhere to the Betty coding style.
- **Restrictions**:
  - No use of the standard library.
  - No use of global variables.
  - Maximum of five functions per file.
  - Allowed to use `_putchar`.
  - No use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc.

## Components

1. **0-strcat.c**: Is a function that concatenates two strings.
2. **1-strncat.c**: Modifies the above to concatenate n bytes of a string.
3. **2-strncpy.c**: Is a function that copies a string.
4. **3-strcmp.c**: Is a function to compare two strings.
5. **4-rev_array.c**: Is a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
6. **5-string_toupper.c**: Is a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
7. **6-cap_string.c**: Is a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
8. **7-leet.c**: Encodes a string into 1337 speak.
9. **100-rot13.c**: Is a function that encodes a string using rot13.
10. **101-print_number.c**: Is a function to print an integer without using `long`, arrays, or pointers.
11. **102-magic.c**: Adds a line of code in a given program to achieve a specific output.
12. **103-infinite_add.c**: Is a function that adds two numbers and stores the result in a buffer.
13. **104-print_buffer.c**: Is a function to print a buffer in a specific format.
